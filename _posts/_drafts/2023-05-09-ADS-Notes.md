## Terminology

### Big Data

Big Data revolves Volume, Velocity, Variety, Value, Veracity

### Methods

#### Associations

determining a relationship that exists among specific events, objects, data

#### Pattern Recognition

identifying data characteristics through data visualization - techniques include histogram, box plot, scatter plot, and other visual analytics

#### Classification

techniques that helps segment values into appropriate groups based on characteristics - helps professionals understand the behaviors and positions

#### Predictive Modeling

A statistical technique to predict future behavior based on previous data, methods include regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and other models

### Classical Definition and Types of Statistics

#### Statistics

Methods of elucidation of quantitative data affected to a marked extent by multiplicity causes

#### Inferential Statistics

a method used to talk about a population parameter from a sample

#### Business Analytics

a broad use of data and quantitative analysis for decision making with organizations

#### Descriptive Statistic

concerned with Data Summarization, Graph/Charts, and Table, and the process of taking data and gathering information

### Vital Terms

#### Population

universe of possible data for specific object, not observed

#### Parameter

Numerical value associated with a population, not observed

#### Sample

A selection of observations from a population, observed

#### Statistic

A numerical value associated with observed sample, observed

#### Inference

Using the information or theory you gained from the sample and then applying it to the population

#### Data v Information

Data needs to be arranged into insightful information

### Sources of Data

#### Primary Data

Data that is collected by an organization itself for a particular purpose, they fit the needs exactly and are up to date and reliable

#### Secondary Data

Data collected by other organization or for other purposed, for example published from research studies, or by the government

### Types of Data

#### Qualitative Data

Nonnumeric in nature and cannot be measured

#### Quantitative Data

Numerical in nature and can be measured

#### Discrete Type

Can only take certain values and there are discontinuities between values

#### Continuous Type

Can take any value within a specific interval

### Data Sets

#### Record

Data matrix that can have cross tabs, and can be relational records, document data, transaction data

#### Graph and Network

A data structure that stores data in nodes and can be traversed through edges

#### Ordered

A series of a data, where order matters

#### Spatial, Image, Multimedia

Maps, images, and video data

### Data Objects, Attributes and Attribute Types

#### Data Object

Data sets are made up of data objects
A data object represents an entity
Also known as samples, examples, instances, data points, objects, tuples
Described by attributes, dimensions, features, variables
Rows -> data objects
Columns -> Attributes

#### Attributes

Also known as dimensions, features, or variables. A data field representing a characteristic or feature of a data object.
Types:

- Qualitative Data
  - Nominal
    - Categories, states, or name of things
  - Binary
    - Nominal attribute with only 2 states 0 or 1
    - Symmetric binary
      - Both outcomes equally important
    - Asymmetric binary
      - Outcomes not equally important
  - Ordinal
    - Values have a meaningful order, but the magnitude between successive values is not known
- Quantitative
  - Interval-scaled
    - Measured on a scale of equal-sized units, values have order
  - Ratio-scaled
    - Inherent zero-point
    - We can speak of values as being an order of magnitude larger than the unit of measures

## Maffs

### Descriptive Statistics

#### Raw Data

Represents numbers and facts in the original format in which the data have been collected

#### Frequency Distribution

Summarized table in which raw data are arranged into classes and frequencies, widely used as a data reduction technique

- Histogram or Frequency Histogram
  - Snap shot of the frequency distribution
  - X axis represents the classes as bins
  - Y axis represents the frequencies in the classes
- Cumulative Distribution Function (Ogive Curve)
  - A type of frequency distribution that shows how many observation are above or below the lower boundaries of the classes

#### Measures of Central Tendency

Large number of such measurements will tend to cluster around a middle value. Also known as Measures of Location or Statistical Averages

#### Mean, Median, Mode

Mean
- Arithmetic mean is defined as the sum of all observation in a data set divided by the total number of observations
- Uniquely and comprehensively defined
- Affected by extreme values
- Can be treated algebraically
- $\bar{x}$ = Arithmetic Mean
- $\sum x$ = sum of all x values
- $n$ = total of number observation in sample size

$$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum x}{n}$$

Median  
- Median is the middle most observation when you arrange data in ascending order of magnitude
- Useful for ranked data
- Not affected by extreme values - greater resistance to outliers
- Does not require measurement on all observation 
- Cannot be uniquely determined under all conditions
- Cannot be treated algebraically
- $n$ = total of number observation in a sample size
$$median=\frac{n+1}{2}$$

Mode  
- Mode is a value that occurs most often, also has the maximum frequency of occurrence
- Mode is resistance to outliers
- Useful when you want to know popularity
- Does not require measurement on all observation 
- Not uniquely defined for multi-modal situations
- Cannot be treated algebraically

#### Measures of Dispersion
Measures of dispersion indicate how large the spread of the distribution is around the central tendency

#### Range
The calculated difference of the maximum value and minimum value
$$range = x_{max}-x_{min}$$
#### IQR
Range computed on the middle 50% of observations after the removal of the highest and lowest 25% quartile. IQR is less affected by outliers.
$$IQR=Q_{3}-Q_{1}$$
#### Standard Deviation
#### Coefficient of Variation

#### Normal Distribution

#### Five number summary, Box Plots, QQ Plots, Quantile Plots, Scatter plots

#### Visualization: Scatter Plot Matrix

#### Correlation Analysis
