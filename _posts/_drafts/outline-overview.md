### Features
    - Observations
        - Continuous
        - Categorical
        - Ordinal
### Labels
    - Indicators of groupings
        - Continuous

### Examples
    - Features with a label
### Process of Data Science
1. Defining a problem
2. Creating a hypothesis
3. Create simple Heuristic
4. Measure Impact
5. More complex technique
6. Measure impact
7. Tune model
8. Decide which has better performance
