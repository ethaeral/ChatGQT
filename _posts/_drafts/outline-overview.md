## Foundational
### Features
    - Observations
        - Continuous
        - Categorical
        - Ordinal
### Labels
    - Indicators of groupings
        - Continuous
        - Categorical
        - Ordinal
### Examples
    - Features with a label
### Process of Data Science
1. Defining a problem
2. Creating a hypothesis
3. Create simple Heuristic
4. Measure Impact
5. More complex technique
6. Measure impact
7. Tune model
8. Decide which has better performance

## Terminology
### Big Data
Big Data revolves Volume, Velocity, Variety, Value, Veracity

### Methods
#### Associations 
determining a relationship that exists among specific events, objects, data
#### Pattern Recognition
identifying data characteristics through data visualization - techniques include histogram, box plot, scatter plot, and other visual analytics
#### Classification
techniques that helps segment values into appropriate groups based on characteristics - helps professionals understand the behaviors and positions
#### Predictive Modeling
A statistical technique to predict future behavior based on previous data, methods include regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and other models

### Classical Definition and Types of Statistics
#### Statistics
Methods of elucidation of quantitative data affected to a marked extent by multiplicity causes 

#### Inferential Statistics
a method used to talk about a population parameter from a sample

#### Business Analytics 
a broad use of data and quantitative analysis for decision making with organizations

#### Descriptive Statistic
concerned with Data Summarization, Graph/Charts, and Table, and the process of taking data and gathering information

### Vital Terms
#### Population
universe of possible data for specific object, not observed
#### Parameter
Numerical value associated with a population, not observed
#### Sample
A selection of observations from a population, observed
#### Statistic
A numerical value associated with observed sample, observed
#### Inference
Using the information or theory you gained from the sample and then applying it to the population
#### Data v Information
Data needs to be arranged into insightful information

### Sources of Data
#### Primary Data
Data that is collected by an organization itself for a particular purpose, they fit the needs exactly and are up to date and reliable
#### Secondary Data
Data collected by other organization or for other purposed, for example published from research studies, or by the government
### Types of Data
#### Qualitative Data
Nonnumeric in nature and cannot be measured
#### Quantitative Data
NUmerical in nature and can be measured
#### Discrete Type
Can only take certain values and there are discontinuities between values
#### Continuous Type
Can take any value within a specific interval
### Data Sets
#### Record 
Data matrix that can have cross tabs, and can be relational records, document data, transaction data
#### Graph and Network
A data structure that stores data in nodes and can be traversed through edges
#### Ordered
A series of a data, where order matters
#### Spatial, Image, Multimedia
Maps, images, and video data
### Data Objects, Attributes and Attribute Types
#### Data Object
Data sets are made up of data objects
A data object represents an entity
Also known as samples, examples, instances, data points, objects, tuples
Described by attributes, dimensions, features, variables
Rows -> data objects
Columns -> Attributes
#### Attributes
Also known as dimensions, features, or variables. A data field representing a characteristic or feature of a data object.
Types:
    - Qualitative Data
        - Nominal
            - Categories, states, or name of things
        - Binary
            - Nominal attribute with only 2 states 0 or 1
            - Symmetric binary
                - Both outcomes equally important
            - Asymmetric binary
                - Outcomes not equally important
        - Ordinal
            - Values have a meaningful order, but the magnitude between successive values is not known
    - Quantitative
        - Interval-scaled
            - Measured on a scale of equal-sized units, values have order
        - Ratio-scaled
            - Inherent zero-point
            - We can speak of values as being an order of magnitude larger than the unit of measures

## Maffs
### Descriptive Statistics
#### Raw Data
Represents numbers and facts in the original format in which the data have been collected
#### Frequency Distribution
Summarized table in which raw data are arranged into classes and frequencies, widely used as a data reduction technique
    - Histogram or Frequency Histogram
        - Snap shot of the frequency distribution
        - X axis represents the classes as bins
        - Y axis represents the frequencies in the classes
    - Cumulative Distribution Function (Ogive Curve)
        - A type of frequency distribution that shows how many observation are above or below the lower boundaries of the classes
    
#### Measures of Central Tendency
Large number of such measurements will tend to cluster around a middle value. Also known as Measures of Location or Statistical Averages 
#### Mean, Median, Mode
Mean
- Arithmetic mean is defined as teh sum of all observation in a data set divided by the total number of observations
2.10 1:41
#### Measures of Dispersion
#### Range, IQR, Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation
#### Normal Distribution
#### Five number summary, Box Plots, QQ Plots, Quantile Plots, Scatter plots
#### Visualization: Scatter Plot Matrix
#### Correlation Analysis
### Vectors
### Matrix
    - Multiplication
    - Inverse
    - Transpose
### Polynomials
    - Line 
    - Quadratic
### Derivatives
### Probability
    - Conditional
    - Distribution 
        - Gaussian 
        - Uniform
        - Beta
