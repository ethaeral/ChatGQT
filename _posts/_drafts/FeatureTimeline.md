1-2 Define problem and project planning
- Identifying problem and objective
- Gather related data
- Quantify success
3-5 Data Preprocessing and Exploration
- Handle
    - Missing values
    - Outliers
    - Inconsistencies 
- EDA to visualize patterns and relationships of data
- Split data into training and testing data
6-10 Model Selection and Training
- Based your problem, choose an algorithm to use
- Preprocess the data further: feature scaling, encoding, categorical variables, handling imbalanced data
- Select hyperparameters for your chosen algorithm through cross validation
- Train and test your model using the train/test data you have split into 2
- Iterate on the model and tune hyperparameters to improve performance
11-15 Model Evaluation and Improvement 
- Evaluate the modelsâ€™ performance
- Accuracy 
- Recall
- F1 
- Precision 
- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Areas of improvements
- Feature engineering
- Ensemble methods
- Experiment with different algorithms if needed
- Fine tune the model further for a better results
16-20 Model Deployment and Integration
- Prepare for deployment
- Build simple API to interact with the model
- Testing
26-30 Github and Documentation
- Create a readme file to document 
- Push application and model
