My name is Rich, I will be documenting my journey on transitioning into a Machine Learning Engineer. I got into Software because of neurophilosphy and cognitive neuroscience. I enjoy designs inspired by nature and I've been on a semi-self taught continuous journey for my goals. Supplementing my journey I will be going through the Machine Learning Engineer Path by Google and Machine Learning Expert by AlgoExpert to prep for interviews.

I will be structuring my blog post through strategic speed learning break downs from the Basics to showcase my knowledge. Comments are welcomed! Will update and give credit.
