Algorithm, Design, Tooling Decision Tree



```
Learning Goals:

What problem do I solve
What is the value of this solution
What does this solution show I have technical experience 
```

MACRO TODO
```
Get involved with the community
Learn relevant technologies, specialize in a tool and understand decision tree and trade off
Focus on software engineering principles and fundamentals
Use known design patterns
Show what you know blog it out
```

MICRO TODO:
- Redo algorithms in MLE in Latex
- Mix and Combine MLE and ADS notes
